            "question_4": "Did you order using a BOGO (Buy One Get One) sale?",
            "answer_4": "<p>Here is how we calculate your credit. The easiest way to do this is to give you an example...\n\nLet's say you redeemed a BOGO for 2 items.\n\nOne was a $15 item and the other was a $10 item. The $10 item in this case would be the item you got for free. But how we calculate it, is you got the $15 item for $9 and the $10 for $6 as the $10 discount is prorated across the 2 items.\n\nIf you return the $15 item you will get $9 in credit.\nIf you return the $10 item you will get $6 in credit.\n\nIn every case, we prorate the discount across all applicable items in your specific order. Don't worry, we'll do the math for you.<\/p>",

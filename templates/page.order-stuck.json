            "answer_2": "Orders will remain in “In Transit” status until it reaches the next shipping hub. Sometimes, due to circumstances that are out of our control, packages may not have an updated scan for a number of days. If your package has remained “In Transit” for 7+ days since the most recent tracking update, please reach out to us to further investigate your issue. You can check the status of your order using our <a href=\"https:\/\/sngapparelinc.com\/apps\/17TRACK\">Track Order<\/a> page.",

            "answer_3": "When making an international order, the destination country may require you to verify information about the order and the recipient. This is the most common reason that your order is not moving or held at customs\n<br><br>\nThe customer may be required to provide the shipper and\/or country with an invoice\/proof of purchase and\/or ID verification. The “Fashion Nova Order Confirmation Email”, should be able to be used as your invoice\/proof of purchase.\n<br><br>\nEach country's shipping policies are subject to change and Fashion Nova would not be able to provide specific information on your country's policies or processes.\n<br><br>\nIf Fashion Nova notices that a package is not moving, Fashion Nova may attempt to proactively resolve these issues.",
